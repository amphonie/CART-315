## Notes for Class 7
I've been pondering the essence of a "good idea" for some time. I recognized my strength in elaborating on existing ideas, yet I struggled to devise a concept that was 1) engaging and compelling, 2) enjoyable to develop, and 3) meaningful. In a discussion with Kamyar, my project partner, we explored game mechanics. I proposed a "hoarder" mechanic where accumulating items increases your power but also brings drawbacks. Initially, this idea seemed lackluster, but as we delved deeper, we found a therapeutic angle to it. Games can be profound, offering a way to navigate and process unresolved emotions actively.

This led us to conceive a game centered on Alzheimer's or memory loss, where the player journeys through a relative's mind to piece together their memories. We envisioned a world that mirrors the disintegration and confusion of the mind, aiming to create an experience that resonates with the players on a deeper level.

## Game Analysis

Find a game that you know well or are interested by. What decisions have the designers made that cause the game to be interesting? Where have they failed? Think mechanically rather than thematically. What ideas/methods/techniques do you think you could borrow for future projects?

In Dead by Daylight, the designers have made several decisions that contribute to the game's overall interest and engagement:

## What works

#### 1. Asymmetric Gameplay: 
One of the most intriguing decisions is the asymmetric gameplay, where one player assumes the role of the killer while the others play as survivors. This creates a dynamic where each side has different objectives and playstyles, leading to varied and intense gameplay experiences.
#### 2. Unique Killer Abilities: 
Each killer in Dead by Daylight has a unique ability or set of abilities that distinguish them from one another. These abilities often dictate the strategy and playstyle of the killer, providing depth and variety to the gameplay.
#### 3. Perk System: 
The perk system in Dead by Daylight allows players to customize their characters with unique abilities and bonuses, further enhancing the replayability of the game. This adds a layer of strategy as players can adapt their playstyle based on their chosen perks and the current situation in the game.
#### 4. Cosmetics: 
The inclusion of a wide variety of cosmetics allows players to personalize their characters and express their individuality within the game.

## Improvements

There are also areas where Dead by Daylight may have failed or could improve:

#### 1. Balancing Issues:
Dead by Daylight has faced criticism for balancing issues, particularly between killers and survivors. Certain killers or survivor perks may be perceived as overpowered or underpowered, leading to frustration among players.
#### 2. Matchmaking Problems: 
Matchmaking issues, such as imbalanced matches, have been a source of frustration for players. Improving matchmaking algorithms and ensuring fair matchups without compromising time could enhance the overall experience.
#### 3. Stale Gameplay: 
Dead by Daylight has maintained its core game mechanics since its launch in 2016, with only minor adjustments such as perk balancing. While initially engaging with a plethora of survivors and killers to unlock, each with unique perks, the gameplay loses its freshness after extensive playtime, as players find themselves repeatedly utilizing the same limited set of optimal builds due to the finite pool of available perks. Introducing new game modes could provide opportunities for less commonly used perks to shine in diverse contexts.

## Takeaway

In terms of borrowing ideas for future projects, some key takeaways from Dead by Daylight include:

#### 1. Embracing Asymmetry: 
Introducing asymmetric gameplay mechanics can add depth and variety to a game, creating unique experiences for different player roles.
#### 2. Customization and Personalization: 
Implementing systems that allow players to customize their characters or gameplay experience can enhance player engagement and longevity.
#### 3. Procedural Generation:
Utilizing procedural generation techniques can add unpredictability and replay value to a game, keeping players engaged over multiple playthroughs.

By incorporating these concepts into future projects while also addressing potential pitfalls such as balancing issues and technical problems, developers can create compelling and memorable gaming experiences.
