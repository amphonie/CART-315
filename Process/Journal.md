"Blur" - Integrating Mechanics and Narrative

Today, I've made substantial progress on the foundational mechanics and narrative integration for "Blur," a game that explores the complexities of memory and perception through an interactive, psychological thriller format. Below is a detailed breakdown of the mechanics and how they interplay with the game's narrative and artistic direction.
### Mechanics Overview:

    Sanity Mechanic:
        Function: Acts as the primary resource for the protagonist. Maintaining Sanity is crucial as it directly affects the clarity of objectives and the stability of the game environment.
        Gameplay Impact: High Sanity levels ensure clearer objectives and stable environments. Conversely, low Sanity levels distort perceptions and increase environmental hazards by spawning more enemies.
        Developer Note: Implementing a high-risk/high-reward system where players might deliberately lower their Sanity to gain specific advantages, such as enhanced abilities or access to hidden areas. This mechanic requires careful balancing to incentivize risk while maintaining gameplay fairness.

    Focus Mechanic:
        Function: Allows players to concentrate deeply, sacrificing Sanity to uncover crucial plot elements or secrets within the game.
        Gameplay Impact: Using Focus decreases Sanity but increases Clarity, which will be crucial for understanding the deeper lore and unlocking narrative pathways.

    Lucidity:
        Function: Measures the protagonist's understanding and comprehension of the environment and narrative.
        Gameplay Impact: Higher Clarity improves decision-making abilities and protects against Sanity loss, acting as a buffer and strategic resource.
### Collectibles and Progression:

    Memories: Serve as key collectibles that piece together the protagonist's life story and the underlying narrative. Players must manage their Sanity carefully to acquire and preserve these memories, which unlock new levels, backstory elements, and essential game insights.
### Enemy Design:

    Creatures: Symbolize the inner turmoil and confusion stemming from memory loss. These enemies consume memories, altering the game's world and increasing the difficulty. Defeating these creatures can restore Sanity and offer resources to strengthen the player's abilities.
### Weapon System:

   #### Concept: Weapons in "Blur" are manifestations of the protagonist's psychological defense mechanisms.
    Examples:
        Resilience: Acts like a shield, reducing damage and preventing memory loss temporarily.
        Avoidant: Enhances dodging capabilities, suitable for players who prefer agility over strength.
        Displacement: Allows players to redirect damage back to enemies, effective in crowd control.

### Narrative Threads:

    The protagonist revisits their own forgotten memories, unraveling hidden truths and confronting past traumas. The narrative is designed to be non-linear, with elements influenced by player choices and Sanity levels.

### Artistic Direction:

    A mood board has been created to visualize the game's PS1-inspired aesthetics, which align with the themes of nostalgia and the elusive nature of memory. The visual style will evoke a sense of familiarity yet alienation, enhancing the game's psychological impact.

### Reflections:

Integrating these mechanics into "Blur" has been a challenging yet rewarding process. The goal is to craft an experience that not only entertains but also provokes thought about the nature of memory and identity. Feedback from initial pitch presentations has been invaluable, directing adjustments to the narrative and mechanics to better align with our vision and player expectations.

Next Steps:

    Refine the risk-reward balance for the Sanity mechanic.
    Expand the narrative to include more dynamic encounters influenced by player Sanity and Clarity levels.
    Further develop the weapon upgrade system to ensure it reflects the personal growth and challenges faced by the protagonist.

I delved into the core mechanics of the game, contemplating two pivotal questions. First, how can a game mechanic embody a human defense mechanism? Second, how can we craft a scene that mirrors the aesthetic of someone's memory fading?

### Mechanisms

To address the mechanics question, I researched various psychological defense mechanisms. My aim was to integrate these into the game's combat system. For instance, I conceptualized a mechanic based on resilience—characterized by the player's enhanced ability to adapt and recover from stress or trauma. This ability manifests as a shield-like mechanism that temporarily mitigates damage from adversaries or forestalls memory degradation for a brief span. Players can invoke resilience when confronting formidable enemies or during critical junctures.

This concept draws inspiration from the "perks" in Dead by Daylight but is adapted into a rogue-like framework, where players select their build at the start of a run. The chosen build influences memory collection, with evasive characters accessing different information than their more confrontational counterparts. However, the specifics of these interactions remain under exploration.

### Aesthetics

Regarding aesthetics, I assembled a mood board to encapsulate the game's visual theme. I aimed to identify elements that intuitively signify memory loss to players. My selection gravitated toward analog film aesthetics—overexposed photography, scribbles, and distortions—to evoke a sense of antiquity and fading, akin to the erosion of memories.

The design of the game's adversaries is still in flux, with a leaning toward representations that embody symptoms of dementia or Alzheimer's disease. These entities, potentially sketched in scribbles or depicted as dark, light-absorbing figures, symbolize the forces eroding the mind, adding a layer of ominous intrigue to the game.

## Notes for Class 7
I've been pondering the essence of a "good idea" for some time. I recognized my strength in elaborating on existing ideas, yet I struggled to devise a concept that was 1) engaging and compelling, 2) enjoyable to develop, and 3) meaningful. In a discussion with Kamyar, my project partner, we explored game mechanics. I proposed a "hoarder" mechanic where accumulating items increases your power but also brings drawbacks. Initially, this idea seemed lackluster, but as we delved deeper, we found a therapeutic angle to it. Games can be profound, offering a way to navigate and process unresolved emotions actively.

This led us to conceive a game centered on Alzheimer's or memory loss, where the player journeys through a relative's mind to piece together their memories. We envisioned a world that mirrors the disintegration and confusion of the mind, aiming to create an experience that resonates with the players on a deeper level.

## Game Analysis

Find a game that you know well or are interested by. What decisions have the designers made that cause the game to be interesting? Where have they failed? Think mechanically rather than thematically. What ideas/methods/techniques do you think you could borrow for future projects?

In Dead by Daylight, the designers have made several decisions that contribute to the game's overall interest and engagement:

## What works

#### 1. Asymmetric Gameplay: 
One of the most intriguing decisions is the asymmetric gameplay, where one player assumes the role of the killer while the others play as survivors. This creates a dynamic where each side has different objectives and playstyles, leading to varied and intense gameplay experiences.
#### 2. Unique Killer Abilities: 
Each killer in Dead by Daylight has a unique ability or set of abilities that distinguish them from one another. These abilities often dictate the strategy and playstyle of the killer, providing depth and variety to the gameplay.
#### 3. Perk System: 
The perk system in Dead by Daylight allows players to customize their characters with unique abilities and bonuses, further enhancing the replayability of the game. This adds a layer of strategy as players can adapt their playstyle based on their chosen perks and the current situation in the game.
#### 4. Cosmetics: 
The inclusion of a wide variety of cosmetics allows players to personalize their characters and express their individuality within the game.

## Improvements

There are also areas where Dead by Daylight may have failed or could improve:

#### 1. Balancing Issues:
Dead by Daylight has faced criticism for balancing issues, particularly between killers and survivors. Certain killers or survivor perks may be perceived as overpowered or underpowered, leading to frustration among players.
#### 2. Matchmaking Problems: 
Matchmaking issues, such as imbalanced matches, have been a source of frustration for players. Improving matchmaking algorithms and ensuring fair matchups without compromising time could enhance the overall experience.
#### 3. Stale Gameplay: 
Dead by Daylight has maintained its core game mechanics since its launch in 2016, with only minor adjustments such as perk balancing. While initially engaging with a plethora of survivors and killers to unlock, each with unique perks, the gameplay loses its freshness after extensive playtime, as players find themselves repeatedly utilizing the same limited set of optimal builds due to the finite pool of available perks. Introducing new game modes could provide opportunities for less commonly used perks to shine in diverse contexts.

## Takeaway

In terms of borrowing ideas for future projects, some key takeaways from Dead by Daylight include:

#### 1. Embracing Asymmetry: 
Introducing asymmetric gameplay mechanics can add depth and variety to a game, creating unique experiences for different player roles.
#### 2. Customization and Personalization: 
Implementing systems that allow players to customize their characters or gameplay experience can enhance player engagement and longevity.
#### 3. Procedural Generation:
Utilizing procedural generation techniques can add unpredictability and replay value to a game, keeping players engaged over multiple playthroughs.

By incorporating these concepts into future projects while also addressing potential pitfalls such as balancing issues and technical problems, developers can create compelling and memorable gaming experiences.
